# AWS Database Services: RDS, Aurora & ElastiCache

## Amazon RDS Overview
- Fully managed relational database service.
- Supports multiple database engines: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server.
- Automates database management tasks like backups, patching, and scaling.

### Advantages of Using RDS versus Deploying DB on EC2
- **Managed Service**: AWS handles maintenance and operations.
- **Scalability**: Supports vertical and horizontal scaling.
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment.
- **Security**: Integrated with IAM and VPC.

### RDS – Storage Auto Scaling
- Automatically scales storage based on demand.
- Eliminates manual intervention for storage capacity.
- Useful for dynamic workloads with unpredictable storage needs.

### RDS Read Replicas for Read Scalability
- Asynchronous replicas of the primary database.
- Used for read-heavy workloads.

#### RDS Read Replicas – Use Cases
- Scaling read traffic.
- Offloading reporting or analytical workloads.

#### RDS Read Replicas – Network Cost
- Data transfer costs may apply for cross-region replicas.

### RDS Multi-AZ (Disaster Recovery)
- Provides synchronous replication to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone.
- Automatically fails over to the standby in case of issues.

### RDS – From Single-AZ to Multi-AZ
- Existing single-AZ instances can be converted to multi-AZ deployments.

### RDS Custom
- Allows customization of database settings and configurations beyond standard RDS.
- Useful for applications with specific requirements.

## Amazon Aurora
- Managed relational database designed for high performance and availability.
- Compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.

### Aurora High Availability and Read Scaling
- Data is replicated across 3 Availability Zones.
- Supports up to 15 read replicas.

### Aurora DB Cluster
- Consists of a primary instance (write) and read replicas.
- Shared storage volume for low-latency replication.

### Features of Aurora
- High performance and scalability.
- Automatic storage scaling.
- Serverless option available.

### Aurora Replicas - Auto Scaling
- Automatically adjusts the number of replicas based on demand.

### Aurora – Custom Endpoints
- Configure endpoints for specific workloads (e.g., read-only, analytics).

### Aurora Serverless
- Automatically scales based on demand.
- Ideal for variable or unpredictable workloads.

### Global Aurora
- Supports multi-region replication.
- Enables disaster recovery and low-latency global reads.

### Aurora Machine Learning
- Direct integration with machine learning services like SageMaker.

## RDS Backups
- Automated backups and manual snapshots.
- Point-in-time recovery support.

### Aurora Backups
- Continuous backups to Amazon S3.
- No performance impact during backup operations.

### RDS & Aurora Restore Options
- Restore from automated backups or snapshots.
- Option to create new DB instances or clusters.

### Aurora Database Cloning
- Create a copy of a database for testing or development.
- Faster and cost-effective compared to traditional duplication.

## RDS & Aurora Security
- Encryption at rest and in transit.
- IAM authentication support.
- Fine-grained access control using security groups and roles.

### Amazon RDS Proxy
- Improves application performance by pooling and sharing database connections.
- Enhances security by managing credentials with AWS Secrets Manager.

## Amazon ElastiCache Overview
- In-memory data store and caching service.
- Supports Redis and Memcached engines.

### ElastiCache Solution Architecture - DB Cache
- Reduces database query load by caching frequently accessed data.

### ElastiCache Solution Architecture – User Session Store
- Stores session data for web applications.

### ElastiCache – Redis vs Memcached
| Feature       | Redis                              | Memcached                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Data Type     | Supports complex data structures  | Key-value only                     |
| Persistence   | Data persistence supported        | No data persistence                |
| Replication   | Supports replication              | No replication                     |

### ElastiCache – Cache Security
- Supports encryption at rest and in transit.
- Integrates with IAM and VPC for access control.

### Patterns for ElastiCache
- **Lazy Loading**: Populate cache on demand.
- **Write-Through**: Update cache during write operations.
- **Session Storage**: Store user sessions for fast access.

### ElastiCache – Redis Use Case
- Real-time analytics.
- Leaderboards and gaming scores.
- Pub/Sub messaging systems.
