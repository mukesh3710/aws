# AWS Serverless Solutions Architecture

## Task: Build a Mobile Application
### Requirements:
1. Expose as REST API with HTTPS.
2. Serverless architecture.
3. Users should directly interact with their own folder in Amazon S3.
4. Users authenticate via a managed serverless service.
5. Users can write and read to-dos, but mostly read them.
6. Database should scale and support high read throughput.

---

## Solution Architecture Steps

### 1. Expose as REST API with HTTPS
- **Use Amazon API Gateway**:
  - Create a REST API with HTTPS endpoints.
  - Enable CORS to allow mobile clients to interact with the API.
  - Use stages (e.g., dev, test, prod) for deployment.

### 2. Implement Serverless Architecture
- **Use AWS Lambda**:
  - Write backend logic using Lambda functions.
  - Functions are triggered by API Gateway.
  - Automatically scale based on incoming requests.

### 3. Enable Direct S3 Interaction
- **Use Amazon S3**:
  - Create an S3 bucket for user data.
  - Structure folders by user (e.g., `s3://myapp/user-id/`).
  - Use pre-signed URLs for secure upload and download operations.

### 4. Authenticate Users with a Managed Service
- **Use Amazon Cognito**:
  - Set up a Cognito User Pool for user authentication.
  - Enable OAuth 2.0 for token-based authentication.
  - Use Cognito Identity Pools to provide temporary AWS credentials for S3 access.

### 5. Manage User To-Dos
- **Database Selection**:
  - Use Amazon DynamoDB:
    - NoSQL database with seamless scaling.
    - High read throughput to accommodate frequent read operations.
- **Data Structure**:
  - Design tables with primary keys and indexes to support user-specific queries (e.g., `PK = user-id`, `SK = todo-id`).

### 6. Optimize Database for High Read Throughput
- **Provisioned Throughput**:
  - Use DynamoDB on-demand mode for automatic scaling.
  - If predictable, configure provisioned capacity with high read throughput.
- **Enable DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)**:
  - Cache frequently accessed data.
  - Reduce latency for read operations.

---

## Example Workflow

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users sign up and log in via the mobile app using Cognito.
   - Cognito issues tokens (ID, Access, Refresh).

2. **Access Control**:
   - Mobile app requests pre-signed URLs for S3 folder operations via API Gateway.
   - Lambda validates user permissions using Cognito tokens.

3. **Manage To-Dos**:
   - Write requests trigger Lambda functions to store to-dos in DynamoDB.
   - Read requests retrieve to-dos with optimized queries and DAX caching.

4. **Secure Data Transfer**:
   - All interactions use HTTPS.
   - S3 operations use pre-signed URLs with limited permissions and expiration.

---

## Benefits of the Architecture
- **Serverless**:
  - Reduces operational overhead.
  - Scales automatically based on user demand.
- **Secure**:
  - Cognito ensures robust user authentication.
  - Pre-signed URLs secure S3 operations.
- **Cost-Efficient**:
  - Pay only for what you use (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB).
- **High Performance**:
  - DynamoDB and DAX ensure fast and scalable data access.

# AWS Serverless Solutions Architecture for Microservices

## Overview
Transitioning to a microservices architecture allows for a leaner development lifecycle and better scalability. This document outlines the steps to design and implement microservices using AWS serverless solutions, addressing both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns and optimizing an existing EC2-based application.

---

## Microservices Architecture Design

### 1. Service Communication
- **Synchronous Communication:**
  - Use **Amazon API Gateway** to expose RESTful APIs for inter-service communication.
  - Use **Application Load Balancers (ALB)** to route traffic for services requiring a traditional load balancer.

- **Asynchronous Communication:**
  - Use **Amazon SQS** for message queues to decouple services.
  - Use **Amazon SNS** for pub-sub messaging patterns.
  - Use **Amazon Kinesis** for real-time data streaming.
  - Configure **S3 events** to trigger **AWS Lambda** for file-based workflows.

### 2. Microservice Development
- Each microservice can have independent architecture tailored to its needs:
  - **Serverless:** Combine AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3.
  - **Container-based:** Use Amazon ECS or Fargate for services requiring containerization.
  - **Database:**
    - Choose **DynamoDB** for NoSQL.
    - Use **RDS** for relational databases.

### 3. Challenges and Solutions

#### 3.1 Repeated Overhead for Creating Each Microservice
- **Solution:**
  - Use **AWS SAM** or **Serverless Framework** for templating and automating service creation.
  - Leverage **AWS CodePipeline** for CI/CD.

#### 3.2 Optimizing Server Density and Utilization
- **Solution:**
  - Adopt **AWS Lambda** for on-demand scaling and pay-per-use.
  - Use **ECS with Fargate** to reduce operational overhead for containers.

#### 3.3 Complexity of Running Multiple Versions
- **Solution:**
  - Use **API Gateway Versioning** to manage multiple API versions.
  - Leverage **Canary Deployments** using AWS Lambda or CodeDeploy.

#### 3.4 Proliferation of Client-side Code for Integration
- **Solution:**
  - Generate client SDKs automatically through **API Gateway Swagger Integration**.

  1. Create a CloudFront distribution.
  2. Configure the origin to point to the existing EC2 instances.
  3. Cache static software update files at CloudFront edge locations.
  4. Set appropriate cache-control headers to maximize caching.

#### 2. Benefits of CloudFront
- No changes required to the existing application.
- Cache static files, reducing the load on EC2 instances.
- Automatic scaling at the edge.
- Reduce network bandwidth and availability zone traffic costs.
- Save significantly on EC2 CPU usage and autoscaling group size.
