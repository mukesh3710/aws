# Amazon S3 Overview

## Amazon S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a scalable, secure, and durable object storage service that enables users to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

---

## Amazon S3 Use Cases
Amazon S3 is used for various purposes, including:

- **Backup and Recovery**: Store and recover critical data securely.
- **Data Archiving**: Long-term storage with cost-effective solutions like Glacier.
- **Content Storage and Distribution**: Deliver static or dynamic content globally.
- **Big Data Analytics**: Store large datasets for analysis.
- **Static Website Hosting**: Host static websites directly from S3 buckets.
- **Application Data Storage**: Store user data or application configurations.

---

## Amazon S3 - Buckets
Buckets are top-level containers for data in S3.

### Key Features:
- Each bucket is globally unique.
- Bucket names comply with DNS naming conventions.
- Buckets define a scope for S3 data access and management.

---

## Amazon S3 - Objects
Objects are the fundamental storage units in S3.

### Key Features:
- An object consists of data and metadata.
- Identified by a unique key within a bucket.
- Maximum object size: 5TB (uploads larger than 5GB require multi-part upload).

---

## Amazon S3 – Security
Amazon S3 provides multiple layers of security:

### Key Features:
- **Encryption**: Supports server-side (SSE) and client-side encryption.
- **Access Control**: Managed using IAM policies, bucket policies, and access control lists (ACLs).
- **Bucket Versioning**: Maintains previous versions of objects for data recovery.

---

## S3 Bucket Policies
Bucket policies define rules to grant or restrict access to the bucket and objects.

---

### Example: Public Access - Use Bucket Policy
A bucket policy can make a bucket publicly accessible by granting permissions to `Principal: "*"`.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Example: User Access to S3 – IAM Permissions
Grant a specific IAM user permission to read from a bucket.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Example: EC2 Instance Access - Use IAM Roles
IAM roles grant EC2 instances temporary access to S3.

1. Attach an IAM role with S3 permissions to the EC2 instance.
2. Use the instance metadata service to retrieve temporary credentials.

---

### Advanced: Cross-Account Access – Use Bucket Policy
Enable another AWS account to access your bucket.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"},
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Bucket Settings for Block Public Access
S3 provides settings to block public access to buckets and objects at both account and bucket levels.

---

## Amazon S3 – Static Website Hosting
Host static websites directly from an S3 bucket.

### Steps:
1. Enable static website hosting in bucket properties.
2. Configure an index and error document.
3. Access the website using the bucket's endpoint.

---

## Amazon S3 - Versioning
Versioning enables maintaining multiple versions of an object in a bucket.

### Benefits:
- Protects against accidental overwrites and deletions.
- Allows recovery of previous versions of objects.

---

# Amazon S3 Advanced Concepts

## Amazon S3 – Moving between Storage Classes
Moving objects between S3 storage classes can optimize costs. You can:
- Manually move objects using AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.
- Automatically move objects using **Lifecycle Rules** based on object age, creation date, or last access.

## Amazon S3 – Lifecycle Rules
Lifecycle rules help manage object lifecycles by transitioning objects to different storage classes or expiring them after a set time.

### Benefits:
- Cost optimization by transitioning to lower-cost storage.
- Automatic deletion of unused objects.

## Amazon S3 – Lifecycle Rules Scenarios
Examples include:
- Transition objects to **S3 Glacier** after 30 days.
- Delete old versions of objects after 90 days.
- Permanently delete incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days.

## Amazon S3 Analytics – Storage Class Analysis
Helps identify objects that can be moved to a more cost-effective storage class. **Features:**
- Provides insights into storage access patterns.
- Supports export of analysis results to S3.

## S3 – Requester Pays
Requester Pays buckets charge the requestor for access and data transfer costs. Use cases include data sharing and monetization.

## S3 Event Notifications
Enables triggers for specific S3 events, such as object creation or deletion. Notifications can be sent to:
- Amazon SNS
- Amazon SQS
- AWS Lambda

### S3 Event Notifications – IAM Permissions
IAM roles or policies must grant permissions for event notifications to interact with services like Lambda or SQS.

### S3 Event Notifications with Amazon EventBridge
EventBridge expands S3 event capabilities by integrating with various AWS services. Use cases include real-time event processing and monitoring.

## S3 – Baseline Performance
- High scalability: Can handle thousands of requests per second.
- Automatic scaling based on demand.

## S3 Performance
Tips for optimizing performance:
- Use multipart uploads for large objects.
- Parallelize GET and PUT requests.

### S3 Performance – S3 Byte-Range Fetches
- Enables downloading object parts in parallel, improving download performance.

## S3 Select & Glacier Select
- **S3 Select**: Extract specific data from objects using SQL.
- **Glacier Select**: Query archived data in Glacier.

## S3 Batch Operations
Batch Operations perform actions like copying or tagging objects at scale. Actions are initiated via CSV manifest files or API calls.

# Security 

## Amazon S3 – Object Encryption
Encryption protects data stored in S3:

### Amazon S3 Encryption – SSE-S3
- Server-side encryption managed by Amazon S3.
- AES-256 encryption algorithm.

### Amazon S3 Encryption – SSE-KMS
- Managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
- Supports key rotation and access control.

#### SSE-KMS Limitation:
- AWS KMS request limits may affect performance for high-volume operations.

### Amazon S3 Encryption – SSE-C
- Server-side encryption using customer-provided keys.
- Keys are provided with each request.

### Amazon S3 Encryption – Client-Side Encryption
Encryption is performed client-side before uploading to S3.

## Amazon S3 – Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
- Secures data during transit using HTTPS.

### Amazon S3 – Force Encryption in Transit: aws:SecureTransport
Enforce SSL/TLS using bucket policies:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*",
  "Condition": {
    "Bool": {
      "aws:SecureTransport": false
    }
  }
}
```

---

## What is CORS?
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows browsers to access resources across different domains.

### Amazon S3 – CORS
Configure CORS for S3 buckets to allow cross-origin access. Example:
```xml
<CORSConfiguration>
 <CORSRule>
   <AllowedOrigin>https://example.com</AllowedOrigin>
   <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
   <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
 </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

## Amazon S3 – MFA Delete
MFA Delete adds an extra layer of protection by requiring MFA authentication to delete objects or change versioning states.

## S3 Access Logs
S3 Access Logs capture detailed information about bucket and object access for auditing.

### S3 Access Logs: Warning
Access logs may contain sensitive data. Ensure they are stored securely.

## Amazon S3 – Pre-Signed URLs
Pre-Signed URLs allow temporary access to private objects. Example use case: sharing files securely.

## S3 Glacier Vault Lock
- Enables compliance controls for S3 Glacier vaults.
- Lock policies for a predefined retention period.

## S3 Object Lock
Prevents object deletion or modification for a specified period. **Requires versioning.**

## S3 – Access Points
Simplifies data access for shared datasets by creating unique access points for applications.

### S3 – Access Points – VPC Origin
Restricts access to specific Amazon VPCs for secure private data access.

## S3 Object Lambda
Transforms data retrieved from S3 with custom Lambda functions, e.g., resizing images or filtering content dynamically.
