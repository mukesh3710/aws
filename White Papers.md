## Disaster Recovery on AWS Whitepaper
The **Disaster Recovery on AWS Whitepaper** provides strategies and best practices for building resilient systems to recover quickly from unexpected events.

### Key Strategies:
1. **Backup and Restore:**
   - Store backups in Amazon S3 or Glacier for cost-effective solutions.
   - Use AWS Backup for centralized backup management.

2. **Pilot Light:**
   - Keep minimal infrastructure always running.
   - Scale up rapidly during disaster recovery.

3. **Warm Standby:**
   - Maintain a scaled-down but functional version of the workload.

4. **Multi-Site Active-Active:**
   - Operate multiple active environments to distribute the load and ensure minimal downtime.

### Best Practices:
- Regularly test disaster recovery procedures.
- Use tools like AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS).
- Monitor environments with CloudWatch and set up failover mechanisms with Route 53.
